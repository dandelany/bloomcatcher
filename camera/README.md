## camera

This section explains how to setup and configure your Raspberry Pi camera, and contains the code which runs on the device.

### Recommended initial Pi setup

This is just the way I like do it, since it enables you to easily test your camera with a live video preview (which only works via HDMI). If you know what you're doing and don't want to connect a monitor, just start with a standard headless Raspbian Lite install.

1. Download latest Raspbian Lite .img file
2. Flash the image file to a MicroSD card (I use Balena Etcher for Mac, and a MicroSD -> USB adapter)
3. Safely remove the SD card from your computer & insert it in your Pi's MicroSD card slot
4. Connect a keyboard and a HDMI monitor to your Pi for first setup/camera test
5. Connect your Pi to a power supply and boot it up
